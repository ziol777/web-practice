<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong>
 <br>and web applications.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
 <br>and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically 
 <br>and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
 
 <p style="margin-top:40px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
    <br>With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. 
    <br>It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics 
    <br>for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
    <br>HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
